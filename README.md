> A Vue.js project

This is the final project from the Udemy [VueJS 2 course](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide).

>I added some extra functionality to what the project called for. The Progress page is all extra. It takes the last saved net worth and keeps it as a high score. This gives the player a goal to reach for. However if the player saves along the way, the high score is reset to whatever their net worth was at the time. It would need extra functionality to keep a running high score, and considering the save/load ability it could easily get so high as to make it seem unattainable. However, I am happy with where it is now as my first Vue app, and there are more projects out there to build.
